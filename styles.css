/* Highlight reply count */
/* This is a general attempt; we might need to be more specific with classes */

/* Target the reply count container. 
   Slack classes are dynamic, but often have stable parts or we can target by attribute.
   "c-message__reply_count" has been historically used, but might have changed.
   We will also use a data attribute selector if possible in content.js to add a class.
